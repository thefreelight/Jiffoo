## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Jiffoo Mall immediately** with **[jiffoo.com](https://jiffoo.com)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for containerized deployment
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Jiffoo Mall site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npx create-jiffoo-app my-store
cd my-store
npm start
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Jiffoo Mall.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-store
npm run dev
```

The `npm run dev` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
