## 📜 Open Source Commitment

Jiffoo Mall is **100% genuinely open source** software, licensed under the [GNU General Public License v2.0 or later](./LICENSE.txt) — the same license used by WordPress.

### Our Promises

| Promise | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🔓 **No Obfuscation** | All source code is human-readable. We will NEVER obfuscate or encrypt code. |
| 📖 **Full Source Access** | The complete platform is available — backend, frontend, admin, plugin SDK. |
| 🤝 **GPL Licensed** | You can use, modify, and distribute Jiffoo under GPL terms. |
| 🏢 **Commercial Friendly** | Use Jiffoo for commercial projects with full confidence. |

### Historical Transparency

> Earlier versions of Jiffoo included some obfuscated code. Starting from v1.0 (December 2025), we have removed ALL obfuscation and fully committed to open source principles. We apologize for any confusion and are dedicated to being good stewards of the open source community.

## 📄 License Section Update

更新 README 底部的 License 部分为：

---

## 📄 License

Jiffoo Mall is free software, licensed under the **GNU General Public License v2.0 or later (GPLv2+)**.

This means you are free to:
- ✅ Use Jiffoo for any purpose (including commercial)
- ✅ Study how it works and modify it
- ✅ Distribute copies to help others
- ✅ Distribute your modified versions

Under the condition that derivative works are also licensed under GPL.

See [LICENSE.txt](./LICENSE.txt) for the complete license text.

### Why GPL?

We chose GPL (like WordPress) because:
1. It guarantees users can always access and modify the source code
2. It prevents "proprietary forks" that don't give back to the community
3. It creates a level playing field for all ecosystem participants
4. It has a proven track record in building successful open source communities
